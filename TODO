load mtree files from C?

hash->list to stdout
hash->info to stdout?
search for hash
list specific hash?

cut / prune / yank / whatever
find tree?
diff metadata? (modes/uid/etc.)

relative roots, in snap, kind of like summary? For input absolute paths.
no saved atime, so .mtree files are identical. (mfilter?)
